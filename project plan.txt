Core Concepts
	Topics: Streams of related messages organized into categories
	Partitions: Subdivisions of topics that enable parallelism
	Producers: Applications that publish messages to topics
	Consumers: Applications that subscribe to topics and process messages
	Brokers: Kafka servers that store messages and serve clients
	Consumer Groups: Groups of consumers that coordinate to process messages from topics
Key Java Classes and Interfaces
